<h1>IT Asset Tracker - Efficient Management of Your IT Equipment</h1>

IT Asset Tracker is a powerful tool designed to streamline the management of your company's IT assets. 
With the ability to add new devices and manage existing ones, administrators have complete control over the lifecycle of company hardware. 

Easily edit the current user of any device and track when equipment becomes eligible for replacement.
The app also calculates the efficiency of device usage, giving IT teams valuable insights into whether it’s necessary to replace hardware. 
For example, if a device’s usage is below 50%, it might not require immediate replacement.

IT Asset Tracker allows for customizable replacement intervals for different types of devices
 such as laptops, desktops, and phones, ensuring that each asset is managed according to its specific usage pattern. 
This way, your IT department can make informed, cost-effective decisions while maintaining optimal operational performance.
